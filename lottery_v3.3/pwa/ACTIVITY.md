# PWA Development Activity Log

## 📅 Activity Timeline

### 2025-07-14 - Project Kickoff & Phase 1 Progress

#### 🎯 Completed Today
- ✅ Discovered existing PWA project structure with dependencies installed
- ✅ Configured environment variables with type-safe validation
- ✅ Updated Next.js configuration for PWA support
- ✅ Set up TypeScript with strict mode and path aliases
- ✅ Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- ✅ Created PWA manifest with comprehensive icon setup
- ✅ Implemented basic service worker for offline support
- ✅ Created offline page for PWA functionality
- ✅ Updated app layout with PWA metadata and providers
- ✅ Created modern landing page with wallet integration
- ✅ Set up Tailwind CSS with custom Solana theme
- ✅ Added utility functions for common operations

#### 🎯 Completed
- ✅ Initialized Hive Mind swarm for collaborative development
- ✅ Created comprehensive project documentation:
  - README.md with full project overview
  - TASKS.md with detailed task breakdown
  - ACTIVITY.md for progress tracking
- ✅ Analyzed existing codebase:
  - Telegram lottery bot fully implemented
  - Solana program complete and tested
  - Basic web monitoring dashboard exists
- ✅ Defined technology stack and architecture

#### 🔄 In Progress
- 🔄 Developing comprehensive PWA development plan
- 🔄 Setting up SPARC methodology workflow

#### 📋 Key Decisions
1. **Architecture**: Chose Next.js 14 with App Router for modern React features
2. **Database**: Selected FaunaDB for serverless scalability
3. **API**: GraphQL for flexible data fetching and real-time subscriptions
4. **Authentication**: SIWS (Sign-In with Solana) for Web3 native auth
5. **Deployment**: Vercel for optimal Next.js performance

#### 💡 Insights
- Existing Solana program can be reused with minimal modifications
- Need to create platform-agnostic components for Telegram/Discord
- PWA features will significantly improve user experience
- Real-time subscriptions crucial for lottery game updates

#### 🚧 Blockers
- None currently

#### 📝 Notes
- Project has strong foundation with existing Solana implementation
- Focus on creating reusable components for cross-platform compatibility
- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing Telegram bot
