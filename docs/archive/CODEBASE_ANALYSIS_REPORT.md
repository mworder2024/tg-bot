## Data Flow Analysis

### Game Creation Flow
1. Admin/Bot creates game with parameters
2. Game registered in database
3. Blockchain program initialized
4. Notifications sent to users
5. Game state tracked in real-time

### Payment Flow
1. User initiates payment
2. Wallet verification
3. Token transfer on Solana
4. Transaction monitoring
5. Database update
6. User notification

### VRF Integration
1. Game requests random number
2. VRF oracle processes request
3. Proof verification on-chain
4. Result used for game logic
5. Fallback mechanisms available

## Integration Points

### Telegram Integration
