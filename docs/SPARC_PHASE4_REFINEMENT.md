# 🧪 SPARC Phase 4: Refinement - TDD Implementation

**Document Type**: Test-Driven Development Implementation Guide  
**Phase**: SPARC Phase 4 - Refinement  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Created**: January 15, 2025

## 🎯 TDD IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

This phase implements the designed architecture using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. We follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for each component, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and robust implementation.

## 🔴🟢🔁 TDD CYCLE OVERVIEW

### Red Phase (Failing Tests)
1. Write the minimum test that fails
2. Ensure test failure for the right reason
3. Document expected behavior

### Green Phase (Making Tests Pass)
1. Write minimal code to pass the test
2. Don't optimize yet - just make it work
3. Verify all tests pass

### Refactor Phase (Code Improvement)
1. Improve code quality and structure
2. Ensure tests still pass
3. Add documentation and comments
